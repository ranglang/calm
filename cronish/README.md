# Cronish Core

**Note**: I moved the [cronish-sbt](https://github.com/philcali/cronish-sbt) 
plugin and the [cronish-app](https://github.com/philcali/cronish-app) into 
their own repositories.

The cronish library can be used to determine the *cron* lingo from any given
string. This library is clearly a work in progress, but it works for the most part.

## Basic Syntax

A typical cron job is said to run *every something* where "something" represents
a single field in cron or multiple fields strung together. An example would be:

*Every day at midnight*

This dsl library makes that assumption as well... in fact all are legitimate cron definitions:

    "Every day at midnight".crons == "0 0 * * *"
    "Every 15 minutes at midnight on the weekend".crons == "*/15 0 * * 0,6"
    "Every other minute in July at noon on the weekday".crons == "*/2 12 * 7 1-5"
    "Every 1st day in April at midnight".crons == "0 0 1 4 *"
    "Every day on the weekday at 3:30".crons == "30 3 * * 1-5"

Let's take this excerpt from the [cron] article on Wikipedia:

    In 2003 CE on the 11th to 26th of each month in January to June every third minute starting from 2 past 1am, 9am and 10pm

Using cronish, we can almost write this verbatim...

    "Every 3 minutes in the year 2003 on the 11th to 26th day in January to June at 1am, 9am, and 10pm".cron

    Cron("0", "*/3", "1,9,22", "11-26", "1-6", "*", "2003")

## Determining the Next Run

A `Cron` object created from an expression, or created manually, can determine its next run from now, or a 
specific time in the future. Here's a few examples of this:

    import cronish._
    import cronish.dsl._

    val cron = "every 10 days".cron
    val now = Scalendar.now

    println(cron.nextFrom(now)) // returns milliseconds
    println(cron.nextFrom(now + 12.days)) // can advance

    println(cron.nextTime) // returns a Scalendar object
    println(now to cron.nextTime) // This is obviously a duration

    println(cron.next) // returns milliseconds from Scalendar.now

    println(cron.nextFrom(cron.nextTime)) // The next-next run

## Creating a Cron Job

Cron jobs are created via dsl language as well. The syntax borrows heavily from
sbt task creation.

    val payroll = task {
      println("You have just been paid... Finally!")
    }

    // Yes... that's how you run it 
    payroll executes "every last Friday in every month"

A job can easily do the following:

  * delayed start
  * exact start
  * reset

An example of the three below:

    val greetings = job (println("Hello there")) describedAs "General Greetings"

    // give a delayed start
    val delayed = greetings runs "every day at 7:30" in 5.seconds

    // give an exact time to start
    val exact = greetings runs "every day at noon" starting now + 1.week

    // resets a job to its definition 
    val reseted = exact.reset()

    reseted starting now + 1.day

A cron task can optionally handle exceptions, a pre-start hook, and a ending hook.
Take a look below:

```scala
// These are formed in the task definition phase
val spoken = job (println ("My name is Philip Cali."))

val greetings = spoken starts (println("Hi, there...")) ends (println("How are you?"))

greetings runs "every second" exactly 2.times

/**
 * Hi, there...
 * My name is Philip Cali.
 * My name is Philip Cali.
 * How are you?
 */

val badJob = job {
  throw new RuntimeException("Something terrible happened")
} catches {
  case e: RuntimeException => // Report this... rollback... whatever
  case _ => Scheduled.destroyAll()
}

badJob runs "every 5 seconds"
``` 

## Cron Management

All jobs described previously are loaded up in a singleton Cron manager 
via the `Scheduled` object.

    // Gets a list of all active jobs
    Scheduled.active
    Scheduled.active.foreach(_.stop)
    
    // Destroys all jobs (same as above)
    Scheduled.shutdown()

    // Destroys a single instance
    Scheduled.stop(Scheduled.active(0))

## Installation

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.philcali" %% "cronish" % "0.1.5"
```
